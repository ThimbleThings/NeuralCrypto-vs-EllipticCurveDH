Dataframes have the following format:

| Purpose | Data |

Where Purpose can be ECDH, NC, or MSG.
Purpose and Data are separated by a ','.
Data is specific to the Purpose and can be structured as follows:

ECDH:   | State | PublicKey   |
NC:     | State | RandomInput | OwnOutput | LastOwnOutput |
MSG:    | State | EncryptedMessage |

State can be BEGIN, UPDATE, or FINAL (left empty for MSG).
In the case of ECDH only two packages need to be exchanged, one for BEGIN state, one for FINAL state.
For NC several UPDATE packages are exchanged, until the RoundThreshold is reached.

Once the Key Negotiation is completed a single MSG Packet with encrypted data
is sent from the Server to the Client using the shared secret key.
